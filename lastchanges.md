This seems good, but before we go further, let's just also think
    about other parts of the application page that need to be edited
    based on these new statuses. \
    \
    Ie: we have a form "Document Preparation" status, so we need a
    "forms/documents" section where the forms are generated that need
    to be sent to the member for signing.\
    \
    What other sections and functionality do we need to include  on 
  both the cu approval pages and on the applicant pages to take these
   new statuses in consideration

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to think about what other UI/UX elements and 
  functionality need to be added to support the new loan statuses. This
   is still part of the planning/requirements gathering phase. Let me 
  think about what each status implies for the UI/UX:

  1. SCREENING - Need eligibility checks, completeness validation
  2. UNDERWRITING - Need credit analysis tools, risk assessment 
  displays
  3. DECISION PENDING - Need approval queue, decision makers interface
  4. APPROVED/REJECTED - Need clear communication tools
  5. DOCUMENT PREPARATION - Need document generation interface
  6. AWAITING SIGNATURES - Need document tracking, send/resend 
  capabilities
  7. SIGNED - Need signature verification, document storage
  8. RELEASING - Need compliance checklist, disbursement setup
  9. DISBURSED - Need fund transfer tracking
  10. COMPLETED - Need confirmation and archiving
  11. TO LOS - Need handoff interface, case notes transfer

  Let me think about what sections and functionality this implies...

> This seems amazing, but maybe a bit too comprehensive? \
  \
  If we were to split this into multiple phases of development, ie: a
   minimum viable product, then a more comprehensive, than a fully 
  comprehensive system, how would you split these?

⏺ Great question! Let's break this down into realistic development
  phases for a UI/UX prototype that demonstrates requirements
  progressively:

  Phase 1: MVP - Core Status Flow

  Goal: Demonstrate basic loan lifecycle with new statuses

  Must Have:

  1. Status Updates:
    - Simple dropdown to change status (staff side)
    - Visual status display with colors/badges
    - Basic validation (can't skip statuses)
  2. Status-Specific Views:
    - SCREENING: Pass/Fail/Route to LOS buttons
    - UNDERWRITING: Approve/Reject/Need More Info
    - DECISION_PENDING: Final approve/reject
    - Basic status descriptions for members
  3. Activity Log:
    - Track who changed status and when
    - Simple notes field for each change
  4. Member Portal:
    - Current status display
    - "What this means" explanation
    - Basic timeline view

  Phase 2: Enhanced Workflow

  Goal: Add depth to critical decision points

  Add:

  Phase 3: Full System

  Goal: Production-ready features and integrations

  Add:

  1. Advanced Document Management:
    - Template generation
    - eSignature integration mockup
    - Document versioning
    - Bulk operations
  2. Underwriting Dashboard:
    - Full risk scorecard
    - External data integration points
    - Policy engine rules
    - Override workflows
  3. Complex Workflows:
    - Parallel approvals
    - Committee reviews
    - Escalation paths
    - SLA monitoring
  4. Full Integration Suite:
    - LOS handoff with data package
    - Credit bureau connections

  Recommended MVP Focus Areas

  For the immediate prototype to demonstrate requirements, I'd
  suggest focusing on:

  Staff Side (Review Interface):

  1. Status dropdown replacing current buttons
  2. Status change reason/notes field
  3. Simple routing to LOS option with reason
  4. Visual indicator of where application is in process
  5. Basic document checklist (not functional, just UI)

  Member Side:

  1. Status timeline showing all steps
  2. Current status with plain English explanation
  3. "What happens next" messaging
  4. Simple action items list (even if static)

  Data/Logic:

  1. Status transition rules (which can follow which)
  2. Role-based permissions (who can set which status)
  3. Activity logging for all changes
  4. Basic validation (required fields per status)

  This MVP would effectively demonstrate the new workflow and help
  stakeholders understand:
  - How the new statuses improve visibility
  - Where handoffs occur between departments
  - What members see at each stage
  - How complex cases get routed

  The enhanced and full phases can then be prioritized based on
  feedback and actual business needs discovered during MVP testing.

> i guess the hard thing here is that the production ready app is 
  what we need before we go live. \
  \
  ok, let's do a complete breakdown of each feature that needs to be 
  added here based on the above that isn't in our current UX. \
  \
  Then ultrathink, write this to an md file with a breakdown of every
   change we need to make to this prototype application (with context
   that this is just a ui.ux prototype to show other people).
