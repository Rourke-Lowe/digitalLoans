# CU Side Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive two-tier configuration system for the Digital Loans application, providing both Credit Union-level and Product-level settings management.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- Extended `CreditUnionSettings` table with JSON fields for:
  - `addressFieldLabels` - Customizable field labels
  - `requiredDocuments` - Configurable document requirements
  - `requiredFinancialInfo` - Financial field requirements
  - `requiredConsents` - Consent configuration
  - `termsOfService` - Terms text content
- Created `ProductConfiguration` model for product-specific overrides
- Established proper relationships between products and configurations

### 2. Enhanced Application Flow Settings Tab ✅
- **Basic Flow Settings**: Toggle SIN and employment requirements
- **Address Field Labels**: Customizable labels for all address fields
- **Required Documents**: Add/remove document types with simple buttons
- **Financial Requirements**: Checkbox controls for financial fields
- **Consents Configuration**: Manage which consents are required
- **Terms of Service**: Text area for ToS content

### 3. Product Configuration Modal ✅
- Clean modal interface for each product
- **Additional Documents**: Product-specific document requirements
- **Additional Financial Fields**: Extra financial information per product
- **Field Overrides**: Product-specific validation rules (min income, debt ratio, etc.)
- Save/Cancel functionality with proper API integration

### 4. API Routes ✅
- `/api/settings` - Handles CU-level settings updates
- `/api/products/[id]/config` - Manages product-specific configurations
- Proper validation and error handling
- JSON field parsing and stringification

### 5. Application Form Integration ✅
- Dynamic field label rendering from settings
- Conditional consent display based on configuration
- Product-specific requirements applied when product selected
- Proper state management for all dynamic fields

## File Structure

### New Files Created:
```
/app/staff/settings/ProductConfigModal.tsx    # Product configuration modal component
/app/api/products/[id]/config/route.ts        # Product config API endpoint
/scripts/seed.ts                               # Database seeding script
/app/test-settings/page.tsx                   # Settings test page
/app/test-application/page.tsx                # Application form test page
```

### Modified Files:
```
/prisma/schema.prisma                         # Added new fields and ProductConfiguration model
/app/staff/settings/SettingsForm.tsx          # Enhanced with new configuration sections
/app/staff/settings/page.tsx                  # Include product configurations
/app/member/apply/[id]/ApplicationForm.tsx    # Dynamic labels and settings integration
/app/member/apply/[id]/page.tsx              # Pass settings to ApplicationForm
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Settings Storage
- All configuration stored as JSON strings in database
- Parsed on retrieval for type safety
- Default values provided for backward compatibility

### Product Configuration
- Optional configuration per product
- Overrides and extends base settings
- Cascading delete to maintain data integrity

### UI/UX Considerations
- Simple add/remove buttons (no drag-drop)
- No preview mode (keeping it simple for prototype)
- Clear visual hierarchy in settings tabs
- Inline editing where appropriate

## Testing

### Integration Tests Created:
1. Database seeding verification
2. Settings CRUD operations
3. Product configuration management
4. Relationship integrity checks
5. API endpoint testing

### Test Commands:
```bash
npm run seed                    # Seed initial data
node integration-test.js        # Run integration tests
node test-api.js               # Test API endpoints
node test-settings.js          # Verify database settings
```

## Usage

### To Access Settings:
1. Navigate to `/staff/settings` (requires admin role)
2. Use tabs to switch between General, Application Flow, Products, and Users
3. Make changes and click save buttons

### To Configure Products:
1. Go to Products tab in settings
2. Click "Edit" on any product
3. Configure additional requirements in modal
4. Save configuration

### Dynamic Settings in Application:
- Address labels automatically applied from settings
- Required documents shown based on configuration
- Consents displayed only if required
- Product-specific requirements added when product selected

## Data Flow

1. **Admin configures settings** → Stored in `CreditUnionSettings` table
2. **Admin configures products** → Stored in `ProductConfiguration` table  
3. **Member starts application** → Settings fetched and passed to form
4. **Form renders dynamically** → Labels, requirements, and consents from settings
5. **Product selected** → Additional requirements applied from product config

## Success Metrics

✅ All database migrations successful
✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
✅ API endpoints functioning correctly
✅ Dynamic settings properly applied to forms
✅ Product configurations working as expected
✅ Integration tests passing

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Settings versioning/history
- Import/export functionality
- Role-based field visibility
- Multi-language support for labels
- Validation rule builder UI
- Settings template library

## Notes

This is a prototype implementation focused on demonstrating core functionality. The system is fully functional and ready for testing, with all critical features implemented and working correctly.
