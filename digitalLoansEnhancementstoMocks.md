# Digital Loans Enhancements to Mocks

Ask magcoop
- What is their expectation on forms (can they just hit "approve"/"accepted") and we take that as a signature
- Do we have to send the member a document when it's created
- Can we get digital signatures on loan documents that are available to members online??
- Once a loan is approved, do we send a form for signature to the member? do we add the form online and add a button "approve", do we integrate with docusign. WHAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR DOCUMENT SIGNATURES

INTEGRATION TO LOS
- Add a button "push to LOS" would remove loan from this application flow and have it now be in the LOS
- Loan gets pushed to LOS when it's approved in the system (how do we get the forms created in this system)

Shorten the steps:
- Merge Personal Details & Address History
- 

Reduce text at entry:
- 

Mandatory vs Non-Mandatory Configuration
- Ensure CU's can choose if field is mandatory or not

Field Name Configuration & Data Pulling
- Address fields, parishes in Jamaica & districts in Philippines, are these separate fields or just names with same backend label
- 

Data Security
- Hash values that are secure for existing members

Existing member validation
- Any ideas on how we can validate existing members
- Ideal process, login to digital banking

Existing member with digital banking vs existing with no digital banking vs new member
- Define the flow for each of these cases
- a FLOW is the different set of screens that each of these users will see, each field that might be available
- System assess if new or existing member or business, sends you to a new flow 

Personal Documents
- Date of expiry on personal document, request new document be uploaded
